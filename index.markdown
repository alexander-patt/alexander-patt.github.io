I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB),
Germany. My primary research fields are labour economics, regional economics,
and economic development. In my research, I focus on the connection between
cognitive skills, job complexity, problem solving and labour productivity.

    
My current work is on

* **International emigrant selection on occupational skills** (with Jens Ruhose,
  Simon Wiederhold, and Miguel Flores), JEEA 2021
  [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaa032)
  
* **Learning by problem-solving** (with Peer Ederer and Ljubica Nedelkoska)
  [[SSRN]](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpapers.ssrn.com%2Fabstract%3D2673990&sa=D)
  

Stay tuned for my work-in-progress results on

* Job complexity and economic growth in European regions

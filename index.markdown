I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB),
Germany. My primary research fields are labour economics, regional economics,
and microeconomic theory. In my research, I focus on structural transformation
of the labour markets and its implications for worker mobility, productivity and
sorting.

    
I currently work on:

* **Home ownership and structural changes in the labour market** (with Bernd Fitzenberger)

* **Labour market tightness and worker allocation across and within firms**
  (with Sabrina Genz and Alexandra Spitz-Oener)
  
* **Play stupid games, win stupid prizes** (with Katharina Hartinger)

* **How to fix occupational information in the IAB Employment Biographies data following 2011 structural break**
 

My publications up to now:

* **International emigrant selection on occupational skills** (with Jens Ruhose,
  Simon Wiederhold, and Miguel Flores), JEEA 2021
  [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaa032)
  
* **Complex problem-solving skills and innovativeness - evidence from occupational testing and regional data** 
  (with Peer Ederer and Samuel Greiff), EJE 2016

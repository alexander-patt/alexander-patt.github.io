### Home Ownership and  Structural Changes in the Labour Market

(Jointly with Bernd Fitzenberger)

  Despite increased mortgage affordability and declining borrowing costs, home
  ownership rates among early-career individuals in Germany have fallen since
  the early 2000s. We hypothesize that this trend is driven by a major shift in
  the composition of employment, namely, the rise of the service sector and the
  growing concentration of jobs in urban areas, which has led to greater
  job-related mobility and higher opportunity costs of home ownership. We
  document these developments and develop a structural model to estimate
  counterfactual scenarios, allowing us to assess how the housing market might
  have evolved under alternative conditions.

### Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes

(Jointly with Katharina Hartinger)

  We use slot machine games to study strategy choice and learning
  under high uncertainty. In this natural yet controlled setting,
  players choose and switch between three slot machine games with
  different (but unknown) winning chances for a fixed number of
  rounds. We find that half of players engage in explorative behavior
  and that the choices of 20 percent of players are best explained by
  curiosity-based exploration: In the exploration-exploitation
  trade-off, these players switch significantly more frequently than
  justified by Bayesian exploration.  This behavior is driven by the
  desire to keep entropy---the element of mystery in the game---alive.
  When a treatment allows players to satisfy curiosity without
  sacrificing expected payoff, these players move towards canonical
  Bayesian game choice. Survey evidence supports curiosity-driven
  element of decision-making in the presence of real stakes and high
  complexity.

### Learning by Problem-Solving

(Jointly with Peer Ederer and Ljubica Nedelkoska)

The standard Mincer model does not account for large differences in earnings
across occupations.  We present an alternative learning-by-doing model that
relates wages and skill development to the level of job complexity of a worker.
Using administrative data on German labour market entrants, we find that wage
growth is positively related to job complexity and negatively related to the
initial level of skill.  We calibrate the model and show that workers in highly
complex occupations acquire twice as much human capital throughout life compared
to workers in simple occupations.  The results suggest that learning-by-doing is
a far more important earnings determinant than investment in education and
training that have been the focus of the literature.  (JEL J24, J31, D83)
